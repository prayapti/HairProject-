### AI-Assisted Hair Loss Risk Prediction and Preventive Care System

Hair Health Derma Care is an AI-assisted application designed to help users understand their **current hair condition and potential risk of future hair loss**.

The system allows users to compare their hair condition with **reference images of different hair-loss stages**, answer a set of questions related to health and lifestyle factors, and receive an **ML-based prediction of whether they may experience hair loss in the future**.

Based on the prediction and user-provided information, the system provides **preventive suggestions and hair-care recommendations**.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This project is intended for educational and research purposes. It does not provide a medical diagnosis and should not replace consultation with a qualified dermatologist.

# 📖 About the Project

Hair loss can be influenced by several factors, including:

* Genetic factors
* Hormonal changes
* Medical conditions
* Medications and treatments
* Nutritional deficiencies
* Stress
* Age
* Hair-care habits
* Environmental factors
* Smoking
* Weight changes

Many people may not realize that these factors can contribute to their future hair health.

**Hair Health Derma Care** aims to provide an early awareness system by analyzing these factors using machine learning.

The application follows a simple approach:

```text
User
 │
 ├── Selects/identifies current hair stage
 │
 ├── Answers health & lifestyle questions
 │
 ▼
Machine Learning Model
 │
 ▼
Future Hair Loss Prediction
 │
 ├── YES → Preventive suggestions
 │
 └── NO  → Healthy hair-care suggestions
```

# ❓ Problem Statement

Hair loss is a common problem that can be influenced by genetic, lifestyle, nutritional, hormonal, environmental, and medical factors.

People often become concerned about hair loss only after noticeable changes have occurred.

The objective of this project is to develop an AI-assisted system that can use information provided by the user to **estimate the possibility of future hair loss** and provide suggestions aimed at maintaining healthier hair.

The system is designed as an **early-awareness and prevention-oriented tool**, rather than a medical diagnostic system.

---

# 🎯 Objectives

The main objectives of Hair Health Derma Care are:

1. Allow users to identify their current hair condition using visual reference images.
2. Collect information about factors that may be associated with hair loss.
3. Process the collected information using machine learning.
4. Predict whether the user may experience hair loss in the future.
5. Provide the prediction as a **Yes/No outcome**.
6. Provide preventive hair-care suggestions based on the user's condition and responses.
7. Promote awareness about factors that can affect hair health.
8. Encourage professional consultation when users have significant or concerning symptoms.

---

# 🔄 How the System Works

The system can be divided into four major stages.

## 1. Hair Stage Identification

The application displays reference images representing different stages of hair condition.

The user compares their current hair condition with these images and selects the stage that appears closest to their condition.

**Important:** The images are used as **visual references for the user**. They are **not uploaded to or analyzed by the machine-learning model**.

---

## 2. Questionnaire

The user answers questions related to factors that can influence hair health.

Examples include:

* Genetics
* Hormonal changes
* Medical conditions
* Medications/treatments
* Nutritional deficiencies
* Stress
* Age
* Hair-care habits
* Environmental factors
* Smoking
* Weight loss

---

## 3. Machine Learning Prediction

The questionnaire responses are converted into a format that can be processed by the ML model.

The trained model estimates whether the user is likely to experience hair loss in the future.

The final prediction is:

```text
YES → Higher likelihood of future hair loss

NO → Lower likelihood based on the provided information
```

The prediction should be interpreted as an **ML-based risk estimate**, not a medical diagnosis.

---

## 4. Suggestions

After the prediction, the system provides appropriate suggestions.

For example, when the user is currently in a good hair condition, the system focuses on **preventive measures and maintaining healthy habits**.

Possible recommendation areas include:

* Maintaining a balanced diet
* Managing stress
* Avoiding excessive chemical treatments
* Maintaining appropriate hair-care practices
* Avoiding harmful habits
* Monitoring changes in hair condition
* Consulting a dermatologist when necessary

---

# 🖼️ Hair Stage Selection

The application contains reference images showing different stages of hair condition.

These images help the user understand and identify their current stage.

### Example workflow

```text
Reference Images
       ↓
User compares their hair
       ↓
User selects closest stage
       ↓
Stage information is recorded
       ↓
Questionnaire
       ↓
ML Prediction
```

### Important distinction

The project **does not currently perform automatic hair-stage classification from an uploaded scalp photograph**.

There is no computer-vision model required for this part.

The user manually identifies the stage using the provided visual references.

---

# 📝 Questionnaire

The questionnaire collects information that may be associated with future hair loss.

The current ML dataset contains features related to:

| Factor                   | Purpose                               |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Genetics                 | Identifies reported genetic influence |
| Hormonal Changes         | Identifies reported hormonal changes  |
| Medical Conditions       | Records relevant medical conditions   |
| Medications & Treatments | Records medications/treatments        |
| Nutritional Deficiencies | Records nutritional factors           |
| Stress                   | Records reported stress               |
| Age                      | Age-related information               |
| Poor Hair Care Habits    | Records hair-care habits              |
| Environmental Factors    | Environmental exposure                |
| Smoking                  | Smoking status                        |
| Weight Loss              | Recent weight changes                 |

These features are used as input to the ML model.

---

# 🤖 Machine Learning Component

The machine-learning component is responsible for predicting **future hair-loss risk** from the user's questionnaire information.

The current ML implementation is based on a structured/tabular dataset rather than image processing.

### Input

```text
User questionnaire responses
```

### Processing

```text
Raw responses
     ↓
Data cleaning
     ↓
Categorical encoding
     ↓
Feature preparation
     ↓
Trained ML model
```

### Output

```text
Future Hair Loss:
        YES / NO
```

---

# 📊 Dataset

The ML implementation uses the **Predict Hair Fall** dataset.

The dataset contains information related to different factors associated with hair loss and a target variable representing hair loss.

The `Id` column is removed because it does not provide useful predictive information.

The target variable used by the model is:

```text
Hair Loss
```

---

# 🧩 Features Used

The major predictive features are:

```text
Genetics
Hormonal Changes
Medical Conditions
Medications & Treatments
Nutritional Deficiencies
Stress
Age
Poor Hair Care Habits
Environmental Factors
Smoking
Weight Loss
```

The model uses these factors to learn patterns associated with the target variable.

---

# ⚙️ Data Preprocessing

Before training the models, the dataset undergoes preprocessing.

### 1. Removing ID

The `Id` column is removed because it is simply an identifier.

### 2. Cleaning Column Names

Unnecessary spaces in column names are removed.

### 3. Categorical Encoding

Categorical variables are converted into numerical representations so that machine-learning algorithms can process them.

The implementation experiments with techniques including:

* Label Encoding
* One-Hot Encoding

### 4. Train-Test Split

The dataset is divided into:

```text
80% → Training data
20% → Testing data
```

The training data is used to build the models, while the testing data is used to evaluate their performance.

---

# 🧠 Models Tested

Multiple machine-learning classification algorithms were tested.

## Logistic Regression

A simple classification algorithm used as a baseline model.

It estimates the probability of belonging to a particular class.

---

## Random Forest

Random Forest uses multiple decision trees and combines their predictions.

It is useful for identifying relationships between multiple input factors.

---

## Gradient Boosting

Gradient Boosting builds decision trees sequentially, with each new tree attempting to improve the previous model.

---

## XGBoost

XGBoost is an optimized gradient-boosting algorithm designed for structured/tabular data.

It was also tested as part of the model comparison.

---

# 📈 Model Evaluation

The current ML implementation evaluates the models using classification accuracy.

The approximate results obtained in the current notebook are:

| Model               | Approx. Accuracy |
| ------------------- | ---------------: |
| Logistic Regression |             ~48% |
| Random Forest       |           ~49.5% |
| Gradient Boosting   |             ~47% |
| XGBoost             |           ~50.5% |

These results indicate that the current model is a **prototype** and requires further improvement before it can be considered reliable for real-world prediction.

Possible improvements include:

* Better-quality datasets
* More training samples
* Feature engineering
* Hyperparameter tuning
* Cross-validation
* Class-distribution analysis
* Better preprocessing
* Additional clinically relevant features

---

# 🔮 Prediction

The final system presents the ML result as:

### YES

The model estimates that the user has a higher likelihood of future hair loss based on the information provided.

The system can then provide preventive recommendations.

### NO

The model estimates a lower likelihood of future hair loss based on the provided information.

The system can focus on maintaining healthy hair-care habits.

### Important

The result is a **prediction generated by a machine-learning model**. It does not confirm whether the user will or will not develop hair loss.

---

# 💡 Preventive Suggestions

The recommendation component is designed around **prevention and awareness**.

When the user's current hair condition is good, the system emphasizes maintaining healthy practices rather than suggesting treatment.

Examples of recommendation categories include:

### 🥗 Nutrition

Maintain a balanced diet and adequate nutritional intake.

### 😌 Stress Management

Maintain healthy stress-management and sleep habits.

### 🧴 Hair Care

Avoid excessive heat, harsh chemical treatments, and damaging hair-care practices.

### 🚭 Lifestyle

Avoid habits that may negatively affect overall health.

### 👀 Monitoring

Continue monitoring changes in hair condition and seek professional advice if significant changes occur.
